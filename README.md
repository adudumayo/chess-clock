At the moment the kitchen cooking rice
and beans
I am reallt bored

So i did what every bored person does

I challenged myself to coding a web based
chess clock in less than 1hr (Yeah I take a whole hour just to cook rice and beans)

So I hope I learn a thing or two

i actually am going to use this chess clock
if it turns out great

# do not mind this line
